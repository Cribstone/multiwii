multiwii
========

Various distributions of multiwii that have come with various boards.

The board manufacturers are not particularly careful about revision
control, so I'm collecting them here as a public service.

Share and Enjoy!

MultiWii_Flip_NORMALQUADX
    Flip 1.5, standard distribution

MultiWii_Flip_PPMSUM
    Flip 1.5, with PPMSUM

MultiWii_pocket_V4
    Now discontinued, HobbyKing PUMQ.  Is there a later version of
    this anywhere on the internet?
